# Testing the Delete Button Feature

The delete button is working correctly in the CodysTools extension. Here's how to test it:

## Why You Don't See the Delete Button

The "Example Mod" that comes with the extension is a **default mod** and cannot be deleted. This is by design to prevent users from accidentally removing built-in functionality.

## How to See the Delete Button

1. **Add a New Mod**:
   - Click the blue "+" button in the popup
   - Enter a GitHub repository (e.g., `username/repository`)
   - Click "Install Mod"

2. **Or Use the Add Mod Button**:
   - If you have no mods, click "Add Your First Mod"
   - This will open the same installation dialog

3. **View the Delete Button**:
   - Once you have a non-default mod installed
   - Click on the mod to expand its details
   - Scroll down in the expanded view
   - You'll see a red "Delete Mod" button with a trash bin icon

## Important Notes

- Only non-default mods show the delete button
- Default mods (like "Example Mod") are protected from deletion
- The delete button appears at the bottom of the mod's expanded details
- You must confirm the deletion when prompted

## Quick Test

To quickly test this feature:
1. Click the "+" button
2. Enter any valid GitHub repository that contains a mod.json file
3. Install the mod
4. Click on the newly installed mod to expand it
5. The red delete button will be visible at the bottom

The delete functionality is fully implemented and working - it's just hidden for default mods to prevent accidental removal of core functionality.
